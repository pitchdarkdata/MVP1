Introducing Smart-review, an application built to revolutionize code review. Smart-reviews analytical approach unlocks your teams collective potential. Given that  Code review is ~the~ one of the few Human centric approach ~in~ ~CI-CD~ , try linking Smart-review with your repo to see an immediate visible impact in your Software development cycle.

Traditionally, the best person to be part of your code review might be your
1. Lead *changed order* 
2. Manager
3. Architect or
4. Statically Assigned Engineers for repo (CodeOwners).
 
*Moved this from last to here*
Also, For too long industry standards for code reviewers are a static set of people chosen by hierarchy or experience.

In hindsight, aren't we missing the services of those who have hands on with the code logic or those who have created the module with classes or methods?

How about getting your code *also* reviewed  by the Engineer *who has the history with the code* you are trying to modify.

How about getting your code reviewed by the Engineers who ~has~ have made extensive changes to the module or author of the Module.

How about dynamically load sharing review efforts among Code reviewers for maximizing efficiency, democratizing review across team & reducing reviewers fatigue.
